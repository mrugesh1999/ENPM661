# Project 3

## Introduction 
This file includes python program solution for Project 3 for
UMD ENPM 661 Spring 2021 batch. The folders consists of python
program along with generated outputs as .mp4 files.
  
    This project will solve given path planning puzzel with Dijkstra algorithm.
	
#### These files are executable:
  * dijkstra.py

## Requirements
       ***Important*********************************************************************
       *If you are using pycharm, the files will be visible in the project file section*
       *********************************************************************************
       
### To run this code following libraries are required

* OpenCV
* NumPy
* heapq
* math
* time

### Installation (For ubuntu 18.04)
* OpenCV
  ````
  sudo apt install python3-opencv
  ````
* NumPy
  ````
  pip install numpy
  ````
## Built in libraries for python 3.6
* heapq
* math
* time
	
### Running code in ubuntu
After installing dependencies, 
Make sure that current working derectory is same as the directory of program,
You can change the working derectory by using **cd** command.

* Run the following command which will START the programe
````
pycharm-community dijkstra.py
````
* Choose the initial and goal position by entering  individual coordinate values


THe programe must be opened with PyCharm and the dependencies must be installed

It is important to note that if both python files are in different directory
we have to change to the correct directory again.



### Troubleshooting ###
	Most of the cases the issue will be incorrect working derectory.
	Double check the path by typing **pwd** command in console
  This will output the current working directory.
  Check if it is same as the python file location.

	For issues that you may encounter create an issue on GitHub.
