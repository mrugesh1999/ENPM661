# Project 1

## Introduction 
This file includes python program solution for Project 1 for
UMD ENPM 661 Spring 2021 batch. The folders consists of python
program along with generated outputs as .txt files.
  
    This project will sove given 5 cases for a 15 number/block puzzle with BFS 
  (Brute Force Search) algorithm. It will generate the path in console as well
  as in a separate .txt file with name CaseX.txt where X is the number of that case.
  
    Note that the programe generates the .txt file, so if you run the program, there is no need to download the file.
	
#### These files are executable:
  * Case1.py
  * Case2.py
  * Case3.py
  * Case4.py
  * Case5.py
 
#### These following files are the .txt output
  * Case1.py
  * Case2.py
  * Case3.py
  * Case4.py
  * Case5.py
 
 
## Requirements
       ***Important*********************************************************************
       *If you are using pycharm, the files will be visible in the project file section*
       *********************************************************************************
       
### To run this code following libraries are required
* NumPy
* timeit

### Installation (For ubuntu 18.04)
* timeit
     * It is an built in library since python 2.3


* NumPy
	````
	pip install numpy
	````
	
### Running code in ubuntu
After installing dependencies, 
Make sure that current working derectory is same as the directory of program,
You can change the working derectory by using **cd** command.

* Run the following command which will generate solution for Case 1
````
python Case1.py
````
* Run the following command which will generate solution for Case 2
````
python Case2.py
````
* Run the following command which will generate solution for Case 3
````
python Case3.py
````
* Run the following command which will generate solution for Case 4
````
python Case4.py
````
* Run the following command which will generate solution for Case 5
````
python Case5.py
````

It is important to note that if both python files are in different directory
we have to change to the correct directory again.


### Troubleshooting ###
	Most of the cases the issue will be incorrect working derectory.
	Double check the path by typing **pwd** command in console
  This will output the current working directory.
  Check if it is same as the python file location.

	For issues that you may encounter create an issue on GitHub.
